## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

ChemistryCheck is an AI-powered chat analysis tool that helps you understand what's really happening in your conversations. Upload your chat history from WhatsApp, Telegram, or Instagram, and get comprehensive insights into communication patterns, relationship dynamics, and potential red flags.

The main idea is straightforward: analyze chat exports to reveal patterns that might not be obvious at first glance. Who's more invested? Are there warning signs? Is this genuine connection or something else? The AI analyzes message frequency, response times, word usage, emoji patterns, and more to give you honest, data-driven insights.

**I built it** to help people see beyond the surface of their conversations. It uses modern web tools and AI to process chat data, generate statistics, and provide actionable insights through an intuitive dashboard. The analysis includes everything from basic stats (message counts, word frequency) to advanced AI-powered relationship health scores and personality insights.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Want to run ChemistryCheck locally? Here's what you need to do.

### What You Need First

- Node.js version 18 or newer
- A PostgreSQL database (I use Neon, but any PostgreSQL database works)
- A Google Gemini API key for AI insights
- Google OAuth credentials (optional, for social login)

### Getting It Running

1. **Grab the code**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chemistrycheck.git
   cd chemistrycheck
   ```

2. **Install everything**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up your environment**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```env
   # Database
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string

   # Application
   APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

   # AI (Google Gemini)
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

   # Authentication (Google OAuth)
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
   ```

4. **Set up the database**

   Run the database migrations:

   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit push
   ```

5. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

The application should be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
